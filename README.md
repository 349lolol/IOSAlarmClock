Basic IOS clock app with additional functionalities built-in

Purpose
Create an all-in-one clock app for IOS and IpadOS users to use instead of the default clock app, with simplified UI + additional features

Innovations on basic clock app
- area to write daily notes
- music selection from a list of pre-loaded tunes
- scroll to set the time, with a button to confirm the next set alarm
- single alarm for easier management, with a more expansive UI
- Weather API integration to remove the need to check the weather app in the morning
- Text-to-speech to allow extra time to lie down in bed while listening to important information


What I wish I could do in the future
- Integrate Spotify API or Apple Music API into the app for additional customization, but I don't have an Apple Developer ID so I don't have access to them

General Notes on the Project
- Learning a lot about Swift!
- Seeing a lot of parallels between Swift and Flutter, which I am much more familiar with, but it's a learning process
